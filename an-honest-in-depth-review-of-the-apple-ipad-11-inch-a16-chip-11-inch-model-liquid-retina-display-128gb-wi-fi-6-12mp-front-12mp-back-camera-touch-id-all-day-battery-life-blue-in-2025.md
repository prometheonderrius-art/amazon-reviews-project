### A Closer Look at the Reviews:

> *"I’m really impressed with this iPad, was a replacement buy for a very old iPad for my wife. Right out of the box, it feels solid and really well put together, definitely has that premium Apple quality feel to it. It’s incredibly fast thanks to the A16 chip, much faster than my iPad which is like 5 years old , and everything just feels super smooth whether I’m browsing, streaming, or using apps. The Liquid Retina display is gorgeous, a serious step up from the previous version for sure,the colors pop, the resolution is sharp, and it’s just a great screen to look at for long stretches. Honestly, at this price point for the performance and display quality, it feels like a fantastic value , and I already have it in my cart for myself as soon as my old one gives up the ghost. Very easy to use. Not having a home button took some time to get used to. Touch screen is responsive..."*

> *"It looks better than the pictures and I am very pleased with everything about it! My old iPad is 7 years old and this one feels so much lighter! I love the keyboard, the one button at the top to open is wonderful! It’s fast, everything looks great, easy to use, set up was smooth for this 72 year old! I just love it!..."*

> *"Once I finally decided that I did want an iPad, I went back and forth on if I should look into the Air or if the base model would be sufficient. I can confidently say that the base model, especially with the upgraded storage in 2025 to 128 GB and with the newer A16 processor, is absolutely worth the purchase and is incredible value for money. I don’t really have any use for Apple’s AI tools, so upgrading to the M processor series for almost double the price isn’t worth it for me at all. I found lots of reviews and forums that said that, unless you are a somewhat serious creative or looking to heavily use Apple’s AI tools, then the base model was sufficient for you. I’m happy to say that they were right, this is perfect for what I need.

Pro tip: turn off background app refresh. I use my iPad on and off through the day, and it will last multiple days with that type of usage. Without turning off background app refresh, you’re lucky to get more than a day out of it.

I use this primarily for surfing the web, emails, watching videos, and as a primary travel device. I’ve had it for a few weeks now, and I absolutely love it. It means I don’t have to keep my phone around for easy internet access when I’m at a home, which is a plus.

As a windows PC user, I’ve always found that transitioning to a Mac or Macbook was very tough, but if you’ve ever had an iPhone, the iPad interface is remarkably easy to use and requires little to no adjustment. Love this product, totally worth the purchase!!..."*
